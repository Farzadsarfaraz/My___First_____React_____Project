📘 Project Overview
This is a simple yet functional To-Do List application built with React.js, focusing on core front-end concepts such as component architecture, state management, and user interaction—all without relying on any backend or external APIs.

The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with all data managed locally using React’s built-in state management (useState). It’s perfect for beginners learning React or as a clean template for future enhancements like API integration or persistent storage.

🔧 Key Features
✅ Add New Tasks – Instantly create tasks via a user-friendly input form.

🗑️ Delete Tasks – Remove tasks from the list with a single click.

✔️ Mark as Complete – Toggle task status between completed and active.

📦 Component-Based Architecture – Clean separation of concerns using reusable React components.

💡 React Hooks – Built with useState and optionally useEffect for state and behavior.

🌓 Optional Enhancements – Includes ideas for adding local storage, filtering, and animations.
